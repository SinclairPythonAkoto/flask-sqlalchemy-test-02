Flask SQLAlchemy Heroku test 0.2

This is a quick app that tests the way I have deployed my web app to Heroku.

I want to test if this process works for me, and how to show information from a database.

If this works I will be able to use this as my own template to make furture web applications.

After spending a VERY VERY long time (roughly 3-4 weeks) using trail & error methods to solve why my database page wasn't loading, I am pleased to say that it is now complete!

Now I can use this as my template for future web apps.

I will also look to build on this web app for asthetic purposes.
